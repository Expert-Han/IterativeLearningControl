\chapter{Application}


	In example \ref{ex:ILC:IAcrushes} the Inverse Model Algorithm is not applicable since large $N$. 	
	That means, we need a trade off between the time horizon and robustness. 
	But there is a problem of the sample time for the most models: mostly we choose the sample time very small (e.g. $10^{-3}$s), and hence even for one second of the simulation we get $N = 1000$. Even if we have SISO system, the matrix $G$ will have $10^6$ elements. Our algorithms become unusable for real applications since they need vast masses of memory.   
	
	We solve this problem by application of the algorithms iterative, for smaller number of time steps. Only the initial condition for each iteration must be adopted.
